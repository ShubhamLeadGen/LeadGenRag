"This could have 3 starter questions FSPU, JOBS, PRS"

"Check if user only completed PII form and did not answer any questions in the survey of default flow (check default flow where full tcpa is mapped)"

So FSPU appears to refer to a specific type of site or user flow related to free samples and products in the USA. The exact meaning is not explicitly stated, but "Free Samples & Products USA" is a reasonable guess given the context clues provided.'
